# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Docker

## Running locally

1. In this directory, run `npm run prebuild`. It'll run `npm install` and set up the environment variables in both the client and the server directories. The actual environment variables have been added to `.env.sample` in this exercise so no other setup is required.
2. Run `docker-compose --build` in the same directory to run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
